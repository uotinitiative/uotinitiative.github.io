            <p>Our mission is to become the only place in the world that people need to visit in order to obtain free, high-quality textbooks in a language they understand. We seek to provide the foundation of content upon which educational efforts of any kind can be constructed anywhere.</p>

            <p><b>2. How do you achieve this mission?</b></p>
            <p>First, by providing open textbooks that incorporate the practices found in the best performing countries. Then, by ensuring the same material is available in different languages.</p>

            <p>Teachers can adopt these textbooks in schools. Parents can use them for homeschooling. Educational technology entrepreneurs can find in them the basic content for building services. As all the textbooks provided through the UOTI are open, you are free to download, share, and reuse them for different purposes.</p>

            <p><b>4. How do I learn about the specific terms of use for a particular textbook? Can I use these textbooks for commercial purposes?</b></p>
